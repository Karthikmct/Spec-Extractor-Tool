4. Steps to Execute the Tool

	usage: SpecExtractor.py [-h] [-f FILEPATH] [-o OUTPUT_FILEPATH] [-t TABLE_OUTPUT_FILEPATH] [-k PROJECT_KEY]        
                                                                                                                                          
	PDF Data Extraction                                                                                                                       
																																			  
	options:                                                                                                                       
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit                                                                                   
	  
	  -f FILEPATH, --filepath FILEPATH                                                                                                        
							PDF file location (default: None)                                                                                 
	  
	  -o OUTPUT_FILEPATH, --output_filepath OUTPUT_FILEPATH                                                                                   
							output Excel file location (default: <current working directory>\data_extract_test.xlsx)                                                                             
							      
	  -t TABLE_OUTPUT_FILEPATH, --table_output_filepath TABLE_OUTPUT_FILEPATH                                                                 
							output Excel file location for Table (default:<current working directory>\data_table_extract_test.xlsx)                                                                       
	  
	  -k PROJECT_KEY, --jira_project_key PROJECT_KEY                                                                                               
							Project Key of the project (default: None) 
  
  i) Open command prompt
  
  ii) Run the command to get both Text and Tables (in different Excel files)
       
	   python SpecExtractor.py -f <pdf file path> -o <Excel file path to get the extracted data in jira uploadable format>
	                              -t <Excel file path to the table extracted data> -k <jira project key>   
	   
	   ** -f and -k are mandatory (required) options.
	   
	   Ex: python SpecExtractor.py -f <pdf file path> -k <jira_project_key>	       
		   python SpecExtractor.py -f <pdf file path> -k <jira_project_key> -o <Excel file path to get the extracted data>
		   python SpecExtractor.py -f <pdf file path> -k <jira_project_key> -o <Excel file path to get the extracted data> -t <Excel file path to the table extracted data>
	   
    To get only Tables from the PDF in Non-Jira format use the script, table_extract.py
	
	python table_extract.py -f <pdf file path> -t <Excel file path to the table extracted data>
	
	here -f is the mandatory parameter to pass the pdf file path.
	
  iii) The available chapters with chapter numbers will be printed on screen console.
        and then user can choose which chapter(s) or range of chapters to extract
        		
		Example as below: 
		
		"""
        Chapter_number : Chapter_name
		1 : 1 Introduction
		2 : 2 Zoned Namespace Command Set Model
		3 : 3 I/O Commands for the Zoned Namespace Command Set
		4 : 4 Admin Commands for the Zoned Namespace Command Set
		5 : 5 Extended Capabilities
		6 : Annex A. Zoned Namespaces Host Considerations (Normative)"""

        Please enter the chapter number(s) extracted : <chapter(s) or chapter(s) range>
	   
	    User can give options like : all  --> to extract all the chapters
		                              1   ---> to extract chapter 1
									  2,3  --> to extract chapters 2 and 3
									  3-5   --> to extract chapters from 3 to 5 (means 3, 4, 5)
									  1,3-5 ---> to extract chapter 1, 3, 4, 5.

** Note as a part of Table Extraction zip file will be generated, which contains html files.
 Also for further processing the zip file will be extracted to the given Excel files generation location.
